            <p>I’m a Mechanical Engineering + PEY student at University of Toronto, expecting to graduate in 2029.
                <br>
                I am primarily interested in robotics and mechatronics systems, where mechanical and electrical components are integrated to expand human capabilities.
                <br>
                I aspire to contribute to the development and innovation of cutting-edge technologies within aerospace and automotive industries, with focus on advancing transportation efficiency.
                <br>
                I have been developing both technical and soft skills through involvement in various groups, design teams and engineering projects.
